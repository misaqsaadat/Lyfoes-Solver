# Lyfoes-Solver
Lyfoes is a free mobile game I used to play it at my free time. after a while I  decide to develop a program to solve Its puzzles.
In game, there are some pipes and there are four balls in each pipe. ( two pipes are empty at start of game). balls have different colors and there are four ball for each color. you can drop balls from top of one pipe to top of another pipe. but each ball can drop only on a ball of same color.(or on a empty pipe) the goal of game is to move balls until all of balls in each pipe have same color.
